# Scripts

Python scripts have been tested on Python 3.

## Generate coordinates for hydrocarbons 
`gen_alkanes.py` generates xyz coordinates for alkanes of the form H-(C2H4)n-H
given n. An example for n=3 is given in the output file `C6H14.xyz`. An image of this molecule
viewed with Avogadro is given in `C6H14.png`.

`gen_C2H2_n.py` generates xyz coordinates for polyacetylenes of the form (C2H2)n
given n. An example for n=3 is given in the output file `C6H8.xyz`. An image of this molecule
viewed with Avogadro is given in `C6H8.png`.
